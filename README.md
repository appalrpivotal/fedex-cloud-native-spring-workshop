# Cloud Native Workshop
Cloud Native Application development with Spring and Cloud Foundry. Join Pivotal and Perficient for a full-day hands-on workshop to introduce key concepts in modern cloud native application development and delivery. This workshop will introduce concepts of cloud-native and Spring application development along with Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  The labs will leverage Spring Boot and Actuator, Spring Data, and other Spring projects.

This is a _loose_ schedule for the day. We will adjust as necessary based on our pace through the material.

The lectures for this class are intentionally very light and are only intended to set the stage for the hands-on labs.
The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent engaging with the technology directly!
