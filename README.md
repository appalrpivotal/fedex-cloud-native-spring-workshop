This is a _loose_ schedule for the day. We will adjust as necessary based on our pace through the material. We'll take breaks as the group agrees

The lectures for this workshop are generally light and are only intended to set the stage for the hands-on labs.
The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent engaging with the technology directly.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

Start by downloading and installing the appropriate prerequisite tools.
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://goo.gl/M0pH4i) to interact with a cloud foundry instance
- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone Github repo or download and unzip
- An IDE, like [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Java SE Development Kit](http://info.pivotal.io/n0I60i3021AN0JU0le10CRR)

**Download materials**

Next, download the course materials.  This can be accomplished either through the GitHub website by downloading a repository zip and unzipping locally, or if you have Git installed, use the following commands:

```
