= Lab 2 - Binding to Cloud Foundry Services

[abstract]
--
The _Orders Service_ application was designed to illustrate the ease with which various types of data services can be bound to and utilized by Spring applications running on Cloud Foundry.
In this lab, we'll be binding the application to a MySQL database.

Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:

Create/Delete:: These operations create or delete instances of a service.
For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multi-tenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.
Bind/Unbind:: These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.

== A Bit of Review

Your instance of _Orders Service_ should still be running from the end of link:../lab_01/lab_01.adoc[Lab 1].
Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:

We're currently running with an in-memory database, and we're not bound to any services.
Let's change that.

== The Services Marketplace

There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:

----
$ cf marketplace
----

and you'll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions.

The second way is specific to Pivotal Cloud Foundry's Application Manager UI.
If you haven't already, login to it by visiting the url the platform team has provided

Click on the ``Marketplace'' link:
The following screenshots are from Pivotal Web Services (Publicly hosted Pivotal Cloud Foundry)

and you'll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:

== Creating and Binding to a Service Instance

. Let's begin by creating a MySQL instance using the MySQL Database service broker.
From the CLI, let's _create_ a developer instance:
+
----
$ cf create-service p-mysql 100mb orders-service-db
Creating service orders-service-db in org Workshop / space user1 as swomack@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Next we'll _bind_ the newly created instance to our `orders-service` application:
+
----
$ cf bind-service orders-service orders-service-db
Binding service orders-service-db to app orders-service in org oreilly-class / space instructor as swomack@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Notice the admonition to `Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect`.
Let's take a look at the environment variables for our application to see what's been done. We can do this by typing:
+
----
$ cf env orders-service
----
+
The subset of the output we're interested in is located near the very top, titled `System-Provided`:

<1> `VCAP_SERVICES` is a special Cloud Foundry environment variable that contains a JSON document containing all of the information for any services bound to an application.
<2> Notice here the unique URI for this instance of `p-mysql` MySQL that `orders-service` has been bound to.
====

. Now let's _restage_ the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application.footnote:[In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only _restarting_ the application via `cf restart orders-service`.
A _restage_ is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.]
+
----
$ cf restage orders-service
----
+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the /health actuator endpoint in the browser tab where you have the _Orders Service_ application loaded:
+
```
"db": {
"status": "UP",
"database": "MySQL",
"hello": 1
}
```
+
+
As you can see, the application is now utilizing a MySQL database via the `orders-service-db` service.
