= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your First Application

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#installers-and-compressed-binaries[Cloud Foundry CLI] for your operating system and install it.

. Multiple Pivotal Cloud Foundry instances are available for use during this workshop, provided by the instructor. Use the API target and username/password provided by the instructor..
. Workshop examples will use http://run.pivotal.io[Pivotal Web Services] as the target cloud foundry instance, i.e. api.run.pivotal.io. If interested, create a trial http://run.pivotal.io[Pivotal Web Services] account to use Pivotal's web-hosted Cloud Foundry for labs.

. From a command prompt, set the API target for the CLI:
+
----
$ cf api --skip-ssl-validation api.run.pivotal.io
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (or use information from your instructor to log on to Pivotal Cloud Foundry):
+
----
$ cf login -u <your e-mail> -p <your pw>
----
+
Follow the prompts, choosing default organization and space.

== Build and Push!

. Change to the _Spring Music_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_02/lab_01/spring-music
----

. Using the Gradle Wrapper, build and package the application:
+
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----
+
The Gradle Wrapper will automatically download the appropriate version of Gradle for this project along with all of _Spring Music_'s dependencies. This may take a few moments.


. Push the application!
+
----
$ cf push
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:
+

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _Spring Music_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `cfapps.io` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Cloud Foundry. Notice that it's uploading _90 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<7> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<8> And here we see the version of Tomcat that has been chosen and installed.
<9> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Cloud Foundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html[Droplet Execution Agents (DEA's)]_ for execution.
<10> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<11> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
You can get the same output at any time by typing `cf app spring-music`.
====

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI.
+
In the example `cf push` above, the `urls:` section of the application health reports `spring-music-hippest-shaman.cfapps.io`, so http://spring-music-hippest-shaman.cfapps.io would have been used to examine this example deployed application. But use the url from your application deployment health report.

Be sure to click on the ``information icon'' in the top right-hand corner of the UI.
This gives you important information about the state of the currently running _Spring Music_ instance, including what Spring Profiles are turned on and what Cloud Foundry services are bound.
It will become important in the next lab!
